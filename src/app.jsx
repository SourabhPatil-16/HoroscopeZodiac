        <h1>Astrology: Real or Not According to Science</h1>
        <p>
          People have been reading their horoscopes for decades, firmly thinking
          that the contents represent an accurate summary of who they are and
          how their lives are going.
          <hr />
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Is Astrology Real or Not:</b> <br />
          For decades, there has been much debate about astrology and whether it
          is real. One fraction of the population believes that the position of
          the sun, moon, stars, and planets can affect people‚Äôs lives,
          positively or negatively, whereas the other fraction believes it all
          to be hocus-pocus. It is pretty hard to confirm and deny the
          plausibility of astrology being real. There are contradictory claims
          going about astrology and zodiacs. Some research done by the community
          conforms to the belief that astrology is real. On the other hand,
          there is data available to prove the notion wrong. Now, which side is
          to be believed? We take the help of science to determine the reality
          of astrology and zodiac signs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>But first, what exactly is astrology?</b>
          <br /> Astrology is the study of how distant celestial
          bodies‚Äîtypically stars and planets‚Äîaffect human existence. People's
          personalities, interpersonal connections, and financial futures are
          claimed to be shaped by the sun, stars, moon, and planets' positions
          at the moment of their birth. According to astrology, each person is
          born under a certain zodiac sign. The constellation that is most
          conspicuous in the night sky during any particular month serves as the
          basis for a zodiac sign. Astrologers predict how different celestial
          bodies will travel in the future and in daily life by using
          mathematics and other techniques to compute the trajectory of these
          entities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How many zodiac signs are there?</b>
          <br />
          There are 12 zodiac signs in total-: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
          Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and
          Pisces.
